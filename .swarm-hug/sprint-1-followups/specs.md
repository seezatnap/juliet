# PRD: Combine Best Wind Sonnets Variants

## Goal
Create a single polished deliverable that combines the strongest sonnet work from `feature/wind-sonnets-try1` and `feature/wind-sonnets-try2`.

## Scope
- Compare the sonnets produced in tries 1 and 2.
- Select the best material from both branches.
- Produce one coherent, high-quality collection of ten wind-focused sonnets.

## Requirements
- Final output includes exactly ten sonnets.
- Each sonnet has a clear title or numbering.
- The set should feel cohesive while preserving variety in imagery and tone.
- Eliminate weaker lines, duplication, and inconsistent voice.
- Place the final deliverable in the project output location for this sprint.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A reviewer can identify a complete ten-sonnet deliverable in this branch.
- The deliverable clearly reflects improvements over either try alone.
- Formatting is clean and ready for handoff.
