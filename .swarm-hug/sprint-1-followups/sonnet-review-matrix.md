# Wind Sonnets Try1 vs Try2 Review Matrix

## Scope
This matrix compares `feature/wind-sonnets-try1` and `feature/wind-sonnets-try2` line-by-line to establish the merge baseline for sprint follow-up task #1.

### Scoring Rubric
- Scale: `1` (weak) to `5` (strong)
- Tuple order: `I/T/V/O/D`
- `I` = imagery
- `T` = tone control
- `V` = voice consistency
- `O` = originality
- `D` = duplication control (higher means less repetitive/cliche)

## Merge Baseline Summary (For Task #2 Handoff)
- Prioritize Try1 as the base voice for pairs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Prioritize Try2 as the base voice for pair 10 (cosmic register), while retaining selective grounded lines from Try1.
- Build hybrids for pairs 1, 7, 8, and 9 using the per-line baseline column above.
- Global duplication risk to remove in merge drafts:
  - Repeated apostrophe closers (`O wind ...`) across Try2.
  - Frequent verb reuse (`teaches`, `combs`, `turns`) across both sets.
  - Generic ethical abstractions in several couplets (`hearts`, `hope`, `brave`, `clear`) where concrete image can do the work.
