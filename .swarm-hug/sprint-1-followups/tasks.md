# Tasks

## Source Comparison

- [A] (#1) Compile sonnet outputs from `feature/wind-sonnets-try1` and `feature/wind-sonnets-try2` into a side-by-side review matrix, scoring strengths/weaknesses per poem and line (imagery, tone, voice, originality, and duplication) to establish the merge baseline [5 pts]

## Editorial Direction

- [ ] (#2) Create a ten-sonnet content blueprint by selecting the strongest material from both branches, assigning each target sonnet a title or numbering plan, and documenting cohesion rules so variety in imagery/tone is preserved without voice drift [5 pts] (blocked by #1)

## Sonnet Assembly

- [ ] (#3) Draft polished merged versions of sonnets 1-5 using selected lines/stanzas from both tries, rewriting weak transitions and lines so each poem is stronger than either source version [5 pts] (blocked by #2)
- [ ] (#4) Draft polished merged versions of sonnets 6-10 using the same approach, ensuring distinct imagery/tone per poem while maintaining collection-wide coherence [5 pts] (blocked by #2)

## Quality Pass & Handoff

- [ ] (#5) Perform a full editorial pass across all ten drafts to remove weak lines, eliminate cross-sonnet duplication, and normalize diction/voice so the collection reads as one coherent high-quality set [5 pts] (blocked by #3, #4)
- [ ] (#6) Finalize handoff-ready formatting (clean titles/numbering and presentation), verify acceptance criteria (exactly ten sonnets and clear improvement over either try), and place the deliverable in the sprint output location for reviewer discovery [5 pts] (blocked by #5)
