# PRD: Harry Potter Poem (3 Variations)

## Summary
Create three original poem variations about Harry Potter. The poems should be distinct in voice, structure, or mood, and must avoid copyrighted text.

## Requirements
- Provide 3 distinct variations labeled "Variation 1", "Variation 2", "Variation 3".
- Keep each poem clearly about Harry Potter (themes, imagery, or references), without quoting copyrighted text.
- Deliver the poems in a single file: poem.md.

## Tasks
Global constraint: The Rust CLI must remain a minimal wrapper around Codex.
- Draft three original Harry Potter themed poems, label each variation, and save to poem.md. Do not add workflow logic to the Rust CLI; keep it a minimal prompt dispatcher to Codex.
- Ensure each variation differs in tone or structure and reads cleanly on its own. Keep the Rust CLI a minimal prompt dispatcher to Codex.
- Review for originality and HP references, then polish poem.md if needed. Preserve the Rust CLI as a minimal prompt dispatcher to Codex.
