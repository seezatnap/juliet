# A Cello in the Evening

A single note ascends the darkened hall
And bends the air the way a river bends,
It does not rush, it does not rise to call,
But lingers where the breath of daylight ends.

The cellist draws the bow across the string
As if to pull a thread from time itself,
And what emerges is a fragile thing—
A voice too old for any printed shelf.

It speaks of all the grief we dare not name,
The joy that breaks before it finds a word,
And every listener hears it not the same,
Yet each believes the truth of what they heard.

When silence takes the final note away,
The music lives in those who chose to stay.
