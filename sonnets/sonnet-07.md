# The Painter's Light

She mixes ochre with the fading day
And lays it where the canvas holds its breath,
Each stroke a word she never learned to say,
Each color pulled from somewhere close to death.

The subject sits behind a veil of dust—
A bowl of fruit, a window, nothing more—
Yet in her hands the ordinary must
Become the thing worth suffering paint for.

She steps away and tilts her head to see
What truth the brushwork chose to leave behind:
A shadow bent where no shadow ought to be,
A light the afternoon had yet to find.

The painting dries, but what it holds is wet—
A world still living that the world forgot.
