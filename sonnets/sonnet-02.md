# The Quiet Vow

I did not know that love could be so still—
A hand reached out across the morning light,
A glance that says what words cannot fulfill,
Two shadows merging at the edge of night.

It is not thunder breaking through the sky,
Nor roses heaped upon a gilded stair,
But how you learn the cadence of a sigh
And find the whole world folded in it there.

We built no monument of stone or steel,
Yet what we share no monument could hold:
The trust that mends what only time can steal,
The warmth that answers back against the cold.

Love asks no proof beyond the steady flame
That burns the same, and answers to your name.
