# The Cartography of Stars

When darkness falls the ancient atlas spreads
Its silver script across the waiting sky,
And every star that burns above our heads
Has traveled longer than a human cry.

We named them once for gods and beasts of old,
Drew lines between them like a child's connect,
And told ourselves the stories they had told
Were ours to keep, and ours to recollect.

But stars care nothing for the myths we weave;
They fuse and fail by laws we barely know,
And all the constellations we believe
Are accidents of angle, depth, and glow.

Yet still we look, and still the looking's good—
We read the sky because we never could.
