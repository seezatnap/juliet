# Tides at Dusk

The ocean folds its silver on the shore
And draws it back as if it changed its mind,
Then sends another wave to speak once more
Of distances no compass yet has lined.

The gulls descend like questions through the haze,
Their voices lost between the salt and spray,
While driftwood marks the passing of the days
In ridges carved by what the tides convey.

I stand where sand and water trade their ground,
My feet half-claimed by each returning pull,
And feel the earth beneath me slowly wound
Around a silence vast and beautiful.

The sea knows nothing of the names we keep,
Yet calls us all, at last, into its deep.
