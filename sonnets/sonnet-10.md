# The Potter's Wheel

The clay begins as nothing but the earth,
A fist of mud drawn upward by the hand,
And spinning finds the memory of birth
In shapes no blueprint ever fully planned.

The potter's thumbs press valleys into walls
And coax a rim from what was once a mound,
While water slips and steadies as it falls
Along the form that rises from the ground.

There is a moment when the vessel holds
Its breath between intention and collapse,
When all the turning suddenly unfolds
Into a thing that no one could perhaps

Have seen inside that lump of silent clay—
And yet it stood there, waiting, all the day.
