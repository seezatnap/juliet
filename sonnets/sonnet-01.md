# The Waking Wood

When April stirs the roots beneath the ground,
And sunlight threads through canopies of green,
The forest hums with each awakened sound—
A chorus older than the years between.

The fern uncurls its fist beside the stream,
The mossy stones hold fast their ancient keep,
And every bough that bends toward the gleam
Recalls the winter it was told to sleep.

The wren alights and flings a silver call
Across the clearing misted with the dew,
While deer emerge along the mossy wall
To greet the light that paints the world anew.

So turns the wood from silence into song,
And proves that spring was listening all along.
