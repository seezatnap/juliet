# The House of Memory

I keep a house no living hand has touched,
Where every room holds light from years gone by,
And chairs still warm from those who sat and clutched
Their teacups while the afternoon slipped high.

The hallway smells of cedar and of rain,
A yellow curtain billows though no breeze
Can reach these walls—yet nothing here is vain,
For memory preserves what time would seize.

I climb the stairs and find my childhood there,
A wooden horse, a blanket stitched with thread
By hands now still, and laughter fills the air
As if no word of parting had been said.

I lock no door within this dwelling place;
Each room I enter shows a loved one's face.
