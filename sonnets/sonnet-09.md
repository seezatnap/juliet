# The Virtue of an Empty Room

There is a grace in rooms where no one speaks,
Where afternoon arranges dust in rows
And sunlight catalogues the floor in streaks
That shift so slowly nobody quite knows.

The chair holds nothing but the shape of air,
The table bears no letter and no glass,
And yet the stillness standing everywhere
Feels less like absence than a mountain pass—

A high, clear place where thought can walk alone
Without the need to answer or explain,
Where silence is not emptiness but tone,
A note sustained beneath the louder rain.

Who learns to sit with nothing learns to see
That solitude is its own company.
