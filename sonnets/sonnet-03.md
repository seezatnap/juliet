# The Tide of Hours

The clock's thin hands divide us from the past,
Each tick a door that closes without sound,
And what we held believing it would last
Becomes a leaf long fallen to the ground.

We chase the hour as children chase the wind,
Our pockets full of moments we would keep,
Yet every joy arrives already thinned
By knowing it must pass before we sleep.

But time is not the thief we say it is—
It gives the dusk that makes us praise the dawn,
The fleeting kiss that makes a lasting kiss,
The leaving that reminds us to hold on.

So let the hours run; they run toward the light.
Each passing day still earns its place in night.
