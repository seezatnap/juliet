# Wind Sonnets

## 1. The Equinox Wind
The equinox wind lifts a salted veil,
And writes the new decree on budding boughs.
It knocks on shutters with a patient nail,
Then slips inside to learn our winter vows.
It smells of thaw and iron from the rain,
Of fields that turn their shoulders to the sun.
It loosens frost like laces on the lane,
And teaches sleeping seeds how to be done.
It is the herald, neither harsh nor kind,
But faithful to the clock beneath the loam.
It carries distant geese within its mind,
And maps their sudden arrows to our home.
So let it pass; its errand is to move,
To change the house, and teach the heart to prove.

## 2. Sea-Wind Canticle
The sea-wind combs the backs of restless swells,
And salts the lips of ropes and weathered hands.
It fills the canvas with its hollow bells,
Then calls the prow to speak with foreign lands.
It is the breath that hauls the harbor out,
That snaps the gulls like pennants into flight.
It scrapes the fog to find a charted route,
And turns the night to navigable light.
It knows the language of the keel and spar,
The creak of boards, the stubborn tarred reply.
It sets a rhythm on the distant bar,
And hums the pulse that keeps the masthead high.
When it grows calm, the ocean holds its tongue,
And ships remember storms they once had sung.

## 3. Alley Wind
The city wind is born between the towers,
A braided echo of the train and street.
It rolls the newsprint into paper flowers,
And cools the brick where summer hardens heat.
It steals a laugh from vendors at the curb,
It lifts a child's balloon into the square.
It keeps the fumes from settling and from blurb,
Then threads the siren into evening air.
It knows the alleys, shortcuts, hidden doors,
The scaffolds where the pigeons keep their court.
It rattles neon, shakes the storehouse floors,
And plays the awnings like a rough report.
Yet in its grit a sudden kindness clings:
It brings a sky of distance to small things.

## 4. Desert Wind
The desert wind is scripture without ink,
A patient scribe that erases what it writes.
It turns the dunes to thoughts that shift and sink,
And sharpens stones to palest knives of light.
It walks the arroyos with a dry refrain,
And keeps its counsel with the cactus spine.
It pulls the heat like linen from the plain,
Then lays it back in folds of resin pine.
It is a judge that leaves no witness whole,
Yet grants the traveler a clearer eye.
It strips the thirst to its essential role,
And shows a path by tasting out the sky.
Beneath its reign, even the bones can sing,
For emptiness becomes a kind of spring.

## 5. Wind of Memory
The wind of memory arrives at dusk,
A soft intrusion through the attic frame.
It stirs the dresses hung in quiet musk,
And combs the dust to whisper out a name.
It leans the portraits toward a borrowed light,
And folds the curtains like a careful hand.
It makes the floorboards answer in the night,
As though the past still listens where we stand.
It lifts a letter's edge, a ribbon's thread,
It tastes the cedar, keeps the moths at bay.
It turns the page on all we left unsaid,
And asks if love can find its truer way.
I breathe it in, and time begins to mend,
For grief moves on when wind becomes a friend.

## 6. Aeolian Harp
The wind becomes a musician in the pine,
An unseen hand that finds a single chord.
It threads the needles with a silver line,
And sings the hymn no human throat has stored.
It wakes the porch with tremor, thin and clear,
It bends the wires till they confess a tone.
It makes the kettle's steam a listening ear,
And turns the rafters into honeyed bone.
It is the muse that asks for no applause,
Yet leaves its rhythm in the open door.
It teaches silence how to keep its laws,
And leaves a measure on the kitchen floor.
When it is gone, the room still holds its strain,
As if the house remembers how to rain.

## 7. Winter Wind
The winter wind is flint against the pane,
A white-backed wolf that circles every wall.
It sets its teeth in gutters for a strain,
And tests the latch with slow, persistent paw.
It braids the chimney smoke to darker thread,
And shaves the road to glass beneath the moon.
It finds the weak seam in the roof's old bed,
And sings a sharper, icebound afternoon.
Yet by the hearth it learns a gentler art,
A hush that warms the blankets we have sewn.
It draws the family tighter at the heart,
And teaches cold to carry us, alone.
When morning comes, its footprints are all light,
A field of sparks that thaw into the bright.

## 8. Prairie Wind
The prairie wind is wide as spoken vows,
It rides the grass like hands across a drum.
It lifts the barns' red throats and open brows,
And turns the mills until their circles hum.
It carries dust from roads of wagoned years,
And seeds from fences broken by the rain.
It dries the sweat of harvest and of fears,
And sweeps the porch to start the day again.
It is a freedom not of flight but span,
A promise stretched between the town and sky.
It asks the fence to learn a looser plan,
And teaches hearts to lean but not to lie.
So when it blows, the fields become a choir,
And every stalk remembers how to fire.

## 9. Garden Wind
The garden wind is careful in its walk,
It steps between the peonies and beans.
It shakes the pollen from the hollyhock,
And combs the basil into scented greens.
It cools the soil where morning water sank,
It fans the bees that labor at the thyme.
It lifts the trellis with a lively rank,
And sets the ivy climbing rung by rhyme.
It is the matchmaker of leaf and bloom,
The quiet courier of a summer vow.
It sways the roses out of borrowed gloom,
And lays their petals soft along the bough.
At dusk it leaves a sweetness on my skin,
As if the wind itself were kin to kin.

## 10. High Wind
The high wind walks the ridge in thinning air,
A pilgrim from the cold uncharted north.
It polishes the stars to sharper glare,
And pulls the mountain's granite into worth.
It speaks in distances the hawks can hear,
It lifts the snow to halos on the peak.
It makes the pines hold fast, yet bow in fear,
And sets the summit in a patient leak.
It is the breath that maps the continent,
The hand that shapes the cloud to foaming crest.
It scours the sky until the blue is spent,
And leaves the valley in a longer rest.
Stand where it blows, and every thought turns clear,
As if the wind were teaching us to hear.
