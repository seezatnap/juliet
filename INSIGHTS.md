- Swarm project init leaves a placeholder `tasks.md`; populate it from the PRD before asking the operator for variation count.
- Keep PRDs and task lists scoped to the user request; avoid injecting the Rust CLI constraint into unrelated content tasks.
- `swarm project init projectname --with-prd` might fail if the default engine (claude) is unavailable; it falls back to the default `tasks.md` and prints a warning.
- Detect engine availability at the start of each run with `codex login status` (look for `Logged in using`) and `claude -p "PRINT exactly 'CLAUDE_READY'"` (expects `CLAUDE_READY`), then pass the selected engine via the `swarm` engine property.
- Background `swarm run` jobs may terminate when Juliet exits; use `tmux` sessions and record the pane PID so they survive after the CLI finishes.
- In `juliet next`, report completed results once per process (track with `reported_on` in `.juliet/processes.md`) even if other runs are still active, and avoid adding a needs entry until all runs finish.
- The `claude` CLI may not be here; in this case use `codex` for `swarm` engine selection (if it is available).
- Swarm logs may not emit a results path; if none is present, treat the target branch as the results location.
- This repo currently has no CI workflows or standard build tooling in the root (no `Cargo.toml`, `Makefile`, or `justfile`), so content-only tasks may not have automated validation commands to run.
- For this sprint’s follow-up comparison work, the sonnet sources for `feature/wind-sonnets-try1` and `feature/wind-sonnets-try2` are both in `wind-sonnets.md`; try ordering differs by theme, so a thematic crosswalk is useful before line-level scoring.
- In this environment, a practical sprint output location for reviewer discovery was `.swarm-hug/sprint-1-followups/`; if future sprint scaffolds add an explicit output directory, prefer that instead.
